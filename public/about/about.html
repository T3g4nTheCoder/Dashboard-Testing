        Hello! First of all, welcome! My name is T3g4n and I have coded this
        absolutely amazing website! <br />
        Anyway 1, this is my about page so i better start saying some
        inspirational things about why I created this website. <br />
        Anyway 2 now that that's out of the way lets get into saying why I
        created this! <br />
        Well, as you know, 2020 was <b>The very best year to ever year</b>; if
        thats actually a saying... <br />
        Well, I am a 13 year old discord bot dev / gamer / athlete / youtuber /
        streamer / etc. <br />
        I only got into coding around 5 months into lockdown. I was very bored,
        watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com" class="aqua">Youtube</a> as
        you do, <br />
        and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com" class="aqua">Youtube</a> reccomended
        me a video from
        <a href="https://wornoffkeys.com" class="aqua">Worn Off Keys.</a> <br />
        I don't remember the exact video because at the time of writing this I
        found that video around i would like to say 4 months. <br />
